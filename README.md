### Clunk ðŸ¦€

Hi, my name is Nikita, I am a low-level software engineer.

Previously, I worked on [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo), [ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse) and [YDB](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb). Currently, I work in an NDA HFT shop.

I am available for hire as a consultant on Query Engines or Databases in general. Feel free to email me at hi@laplab.me.
