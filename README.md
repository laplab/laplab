Hi, my name is Nikita. I am a low-level Rust engineer.

I work at Cloudflare. My focus is databases and query engines. Previously, I worked on MongoDB, ClickHouse and Yandex Database. I also worked on storage solutions in an NDA high-frequency trading company and performance optimisations in Prisma ORM.

Outside of work, I'm a role-playing games nerd. I run a D&D campaign for my friends and love experimenting with new systems. If you know a cool RPG or an adventure for one, I would be very interested to hear about it!
