Hi, my name is Nikita, I am a low-level Rust engineer.

### Stuff I worked on before

- **New Query Engine of [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo).** I worked on a compiler to lower queries into internal bytecode as well as a virtual machine to execute this bytecode. Had a lof of fun with performance optimization and correctness.
- **Query Profiler of [ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse).** Implemented low-overhead, always-running sampling profiler, showing which lines of code were slow for a particular query. [This feature](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/optimizing-performance/sampling-query-profiler) is turned on by default on all ClickHouse deployments (cloud and on-premise).
- **JSON Querying and Binary Storage in [YDB](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb).** Added functionality to query JSON documents from SQL. I have also invented a [custom binary format](https://laplab.me/posts/how-binary-json-works-in-ydb/) to store JSON documents to optimize read performance.

And some other closed-source stuff as well. This was all in C++, but then I [decided to switch to Rust](https://laplab.me/posts/switching-from-cpp-to-rust/).

### Things I do now

- I work in an NDA High-Frequency Trading company. Here, I am one of the developers of the main Rust server responsible for all trading operations.
- Open-source Rust, see pinned repositories.
- Occasional [microcontroller shenanigans](https://laplab.me/posts/family-photos-vs-256-kb-ram/).

### How to contact me

- I am available for hire for short-term consulting and training.
- The best way to reach me is by email: hi@laplab.me. I usually respond within the same day if I am not on a vacation.
- Memes and experiments can be found on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@laplab).
- You can also ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikitalapkov/).
